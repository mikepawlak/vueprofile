# Mike Pawlak - Web Developer

This is the code for my portfolio site - [mikepawlak.com](https://www.mikepawlak.com). I made this code available to show how I'd put together a project like this. This site used NodeJS and Express on the backend and Webpack and VueJS for the frontend with styles created with Bulma. You can view a full list of this project's depencies [here](https://github.com/mikepawlak/vueprofile/network/dependencies).
